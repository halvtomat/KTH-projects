Question:
1/  
    a)  
    b)
	BST pre WOEALH, in AEHLOW, post AHLEOW.
	RBBST pre OEALHW, in AEHLOW, post AHLEWO.

2/	none, it should be prime or power 2.

4/  Commandline argument "Measure-Command" to compare execution times, the algorithms had similar exec.times.

5/  BST because i think its a more intressting structure.

6/  BST     best: 365ms worst: 444 average: 412
    RBBST   best: 365ms worst: 451 average: 393
    Java clock used to measure execution time.
    Red Black tree has guaranteed best case performance 
    but it seems like the BST has pretty good average performance in this case,
    very similar times, variation probably because of other variables.
