\section{Introduction}

Everyone who has ever tried programming in C should have heard of "malloc" and "free", these two functions provide a way for the programmer to easily
allocate memory on the heap of a process. Modern day memory management is fast and efficient, but what acctually goes on under the hood of the
operating system when a process calls "malloc"? In this report I will create my own heap manager similar to "malloc" and explore different aspects 
approaches, can i make it really space-efficient? Will it have a speed payoff? Continue reading and you will find answers.

\section{Background}

To create your own heap manager, you first need to understand how a heap manager works. The traditional way is to have a linked list data-structure 
where you keep all the free blocks from your heap, then when the process wants to allocate something the manager finds a free block with appropriate
size and returns the virtual memory address. Later when (hopefully) "free" is called by the process, the manager will put the newly freed block 
back in the list of free blocks. To make this possible we need to implement a couple things. Firstly we need to get memory from the operating system
, we can do this with the "mmap" system call, we should get as much memory as we think the process will use right from the start because 
calling the system to get more all the time would be very performance costly. Now we need a header with some information to be stored in every block
on the heap. To start, the header should contain the following information,
\begin{itemize}
    \item Free - if the block is free or taken
    \item Size - the size of the block
    \item Bfree - if the block before is free or taken
    \item Bsize - the size of the block before
    \item Next - pointer to the next block in the list
    \item Prev - pointer to the previous block in the list
\end{itemize}

When a block is requested by the process, we need to make sure the process wont get a block that is
